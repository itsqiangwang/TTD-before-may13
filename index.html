                <p>
                    <i>Time to Dream</i> is a collection of short dance films that acknowledges oppressive forces of the
                    past and
                    present, in order to envision a better future.
                    <br><br>
                    This project was created during the global pandemic, while racially driven crimes and social
                    injustices
                    were openly broadcasted, showing the depth of a flawed system. In the hope of change, we work with
                    ideas
                    of group dynamics, oppression, and liberation within our bodies. Snapshots of individual journeys,
                    of
                    people trying to come together, to re-evaluate and reshape their ways in order to achieve peace,
                    freedom, and joy.
                    <br><br>
                    The films have been traveling to the following festivals:

                <p>
                    <i>Time to Dream</i> was created during the COVID-19 global pandemic, while racially-driven crimes
                    and
                    social injustices were openly broadcast, exposing further our deeply flawed systems.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During this challenging and constantly fluctuating time, I found hope in the future. I thought that
                    one way to start to create and re-shape a better future would be to imagine it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <i>Time to Dream</i> represents some possibilities that are revealed when we acknowledge current
                    challenges, structures and beliefs, and make way for new ways of thinking and being.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In creating change and finding freedom we also need to recognize what has already been done. How can
                    we unburden a body that is still confined?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Most of our kinetic research was based on oppositions such as tension and release, external and
                    internal forces, as well as feelings and images of complexity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to bridge the past and the future, I thought of tipping into a dreamy state, a subconscious
                    mystical mixture of elements that could open up a new awareness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With this collection of short films, we wanted to honor individual journeys that attune to a wave of
                    change. In reality, <i>Time to Dream</i> starts after our last film <i>Time to Begin</i>, giving the
                    chance to
                    each and every one of us to envision a different future.

                            major at UCLA and has been involved in WACSmash (a student-choreographed and
                            student-organized show), a virtual piece called When is Good (choreographed by Faye
                            Driscoll), and has made a few short dance films. She has fallen in love with improvisation
                            work and techniques, and values dance and movement practices as an appreciation and love of
                            the human body. She enjoys fluid, rounded movement best and strives to achieve a sense of
                            flow in her movement practice.

                            Tyler Law is a Dance Major and Film, Television, and Digital Media Minor at UCLA. She grew
                            up doing Chinese dance and ballet before discovering her love for hip hop and street-style
                            choreography. She also participated in choir and theater throughout high school. Her
                            involvement with UCLA’s institutional-level performance and study opportunities graciously
                            provided her the chance to further explore the arts – a field she is very passionate about.
                            This is her second project with Marianna, and she would like to thank Marianna and her peers
                            for their support throughout this process. Despite difficult circumstances complicating the
                            creation of this piece, Time To Dream is nevertheless a reflection of dedication,
                            discipline, and hope.

                    Selcouth is the platform that produces the work of Marianna Varviani and collaborators.
                    <br><br>
                    We believe art can change the world! We create works to invoke, empower, and inspire the people
                    around us. Our core ideals revolve around understanding, appreciation, respect, and liberation. We
                    create, produce, and share high-quality performances and interactive art experiences, based on
                    contemporary issues. We invite audiences of all backgrounds, ages, and interests. Through our
                    project, we hope to bridge concert, street, commercial and academic cultures.
